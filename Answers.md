3.	Merge into Main Branch:
o	Push the branch:
bash
Copy code
git push origin new-branch-name
o	Create a pull request on GitHub and merge.
Pull Requests and Code Reviews
1.	Pull Requests:
o	Click "Pull requests" > "New pull request."
o	Select branches and create the pull request with a title and description.
